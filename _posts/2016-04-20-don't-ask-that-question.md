I've always been afraid of asking stupid questions. Silly, right? So I usually
make sure I've done thorough research before asking a question when I get stuck.
I also hate not understanding how things work. So I just try to figure them out.
You should do the same!

# Don't ask how

When I get stuck, I'll first turn to [Google](https://www.google.com) or
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) to seek some guidance. Or try to find
something similar in the project and see how it's done there. Asking "how" is
often just laziness. Whatever the problem, someone somewhere has likely also
encountered it before and you can base your solution on their work most of the
time. You don't need anyone else to find that for you.

The solution may not work for your use case, so now it's up to you to figure out
why that is. Is something broken, was the implementation flawed or is something
else interfering? Or maybe your use case is just very different? Dig into it,
try out a couple of things, RTFM and figure out why it's not working. You'll
grow a much more thorough insight in the problem domain.

# 20 minute rule

We had this rule of thumb at a previous company. Other people's time is valuable
and they're working on solving their own problems, you don't just want to
interrupt their own thought process. If you do get stuck, by all means ask
someone to help you out, but not before having looked into it for at least 20
minutes.

# Rubber ducking

But you may get stuck on that nasty problem for awhile and still get nowhere.
You don't want to disturb your coworkers, but staring at the problem and coming
up blank after exhausting every possibility is no good use of your time either.

Try explaining the problem to someone else in great detail, without actually
doing so. I start to draft an email to a colleague to explain my problem.
I usually outline the problem, and every possible solution I've considered and
attempted to resolve it, and why it failed. Quite often, this exercise will
result in never having to send that email at all. Going over everything again,
I'll discover a detail I overlooked or find some flawed assumption in one of
my attempts.

# Be specific

If you do ask for help, be as specific as possible. Don't tell them your problem
and expect them to come up with a solution: chances are they'll spend a lot of
time only to come up with a potential solution you've already discarded because
it didn't work.

Ask them **why** this particular thing you've tried doing isn't working out.
By now, you've at least narrowed down the problem. And it likely has something
to do with some component you don't know much about. Ask them to explain how it
works. Show them you've done your research! And when they do come up with a
solution, don't just implement it, make sure you understand exactly why their
solution works!

**Don't be afraid to ask questions (really, don't!) but do your research first!**
