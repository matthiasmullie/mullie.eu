Since I started working remotely, now almost 3 years ago, I've learned a thing
or two about my productivity. While not necessarily a direct result of working
remotely, it sure helped me realize how to work more efficiently.

# 1. Communication != meetings

A 9 hour timezone difference means having no convenient overlap to have
meetings. We're flexible and still have some - usually in their early mornings,
my evenings - but having days packed with meetings is just not an option.

We do most of the communication over email or IRC. Or, as we say: "if it's not
in the mailing list, it didn't happen." Instead of opaqueness to anyone not in
the meeting, or confusion a couple of weeks later, we have written records of
the discussion and the outcome.


# 2. No meeting is urgent

In addition, this kind of [asynchronous communication](http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-asynchronous/)
is useful because it allows everyone to contribute to the discussion at their
own pace, without being interrupted in their work.

As a remotee, I can't just walk up to my colleagues. If I forget to discuss
something, it'll have to wait another day. Once you get used to it, you'll be
surprised how little is forgotten! Once you can't physically bother your
colleagues, you'll notice how seldom an interruption of their concentration (and
yours) is warranted.


# 3. Work when you work best

I used to get up early to go to work. Since I started working remotely & find
myself in another timezone, that changed. The daily standup call is in my evenings so
that's where my schedule started drifting to.

I'm not a morning person: afternoon & evenings is when I get my work done. I
still work the same amount of time, but I can now wake up full of energy, ready
to tackle today's big challenges.

And sometimes, I have one of those days where I'm really on a roll and don't
stop before finally wrapping things up at night. Furthermore, being able to run
personal errands during business hours also makes organising life a lot easier.


# 4. Find time to focus

Instead of scrambling for little bits of time in between meetings and other
interruptions, I can now focus for longer periods of time - the rest of my team
is sleeping anyway!

Since I somewhat resemble a zombie in the morning, that's when I do tedious
tasks like triaging email, following up on projects & reviewing trivial patches.
Afternoons are dedicated to coding, for hours on end, perfect to get [in the zone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29)!


# 5. Focus on work, not hours

In a creative endeavor like programming, there's no real tangible, measurable
*unit of work*, so quantifying it is quite hard. There's little direct
correlation between hours and amount of work done. Usually, you just know when
you've done well: you'll feel intense self-satisfaction about your work.

I start work knowing that I don't have to sit there & look busy for 8 hours. I
can leave anytime & take a break. I can be perfectly happy after having worked
only a couple of really productive hours.

But I still have unproductive days too, where procrastination gets the upper
hand. Then too, focusing on the passing time is not the most productive
solution. Unless you like that feeling after an entire day of getting nowhere,
take a break (not from work per se, but from that task), clear your
head & come back with renewed ideas & motivation.
