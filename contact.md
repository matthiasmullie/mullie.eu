# Matthias Mullie

I'm a staff software engineer with over a decade of experience in building web
applications, mostly in PHP, Python, MySQL, JavaScript & related tech.
I care about code architecture.
I love hard challenges, clean code & learning new things.
I firmly believe in applying the boy scout rule to code.
Iâ€™m pragmatic and able to get things done.
I play soccer, like to run & love traveling.

I rolled into software development with video games: I found hacking them a lot
of fun. *I'm sorry for ruining the game!*

My first job landed me in an agency with a team of terrific software engineers
and designers, all very passionate about making the internet a better place.
We open-sourced [Fork CMS](https://www.fork-cms.com/) and had a great time!

I was very happy to join [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) next, where I've
implemented many new features with work ranging across the stack *(a selection:
notifications, discussion board, structured (meta)data for multimedia & media search.)*
Not only did I learn a lot about scaling a big application, I also became part
of one of the best initiatives on the internet.
Wikipedia means a lot to the world, [don't forget to donate!](https://donate.wikimedia.org/)
