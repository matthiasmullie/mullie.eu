# Matthias Mullie

I'm a staff software engineer with an appetite for complex problems. I'm easy
going & take responsibility for my work. I care about code architecture. I love
hard challenges, clean code & learning new things. Bonus points for open source.

I rolled into software development with video games: I found hacking them a lot
of fun. I'm sorry for ruining the game!

My first job landed me in an agency with a team of terrific software engineers
and designers, all very passionate about making the internet a better place.
We open-sourced [Fork CMS](https://www.fork-cms.com/). Good times!

I was very happy to join [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) next. Not only
did I learn a lot about scaling a big application, I also became part of one of
the best initiatives on the internet. Wikipedia means a lot to the world,
